					<h2>Man of Steel: Reviewed</h2>
					<h4>Posted 14 September 2013, by Anirudh Menon.</h4>

				<p>
					When man of steel was announced last year, I was ecstatic, the prospect of a new superman film after waiting for 7 years was a dream come true for me and just for the record, I am among the (apparently) very few that actually enjoyed superman returns. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Then came the first picture of superman as he would be shown in the film and although, initially I had reservations seeing a superman who wasn't wearing his trademark briefs or sporting his equally famous 's' curl but I gradually came to like the costume and also admired the talent that they had brought in to play superman (Henry Cavill).
				</p>
				<p>
					When the film finally released, I saw it on its second day of release and I have got quite a few things to say about it.

					The first thing about this film that I noticed was that this is a very different animal from the Christopher reeve films from the 1970's it has a more, how do you put it... "nolanized" feel to the whole setup which may seem like a good thing but need not necessarily be one.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are all familiar with the origins of superman and I think even putting up a synopsis here would be a tad redundant.

					Anyway, in this iteration of the man of steel, after a lengthy introduction on Krypton setting up the villain General Zod ( played quite randomly by Michael Shannon), we see Clark Kent as a drifter, doing odd jobs and trying to find a place in society.
				</p>

				<p>
					We learn of Clark's eventful childhood through a couple of strategically placed flashback s that involve Clark learning a lot of life lessons from his adopted earth parents Jonathan and Martha Kent ( Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). After a couple of trysts with reporter Lois lane and discovering an old kryptonian spaceship in Antarctica which incidentally, also contains superman's' new duds and a couple of monologues from Clark's space father (Jor-El played by a very constipated Russell Crowe) later, our new superman is good to go and face off against General Zod who has returned to "terraform" Earth into another krypton.
